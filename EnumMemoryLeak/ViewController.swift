//  Looks like the leak referenced at SwiftLeaks fixed by Apple
//  However when you do use @objc in Swift for the Enum
//  the same issue surfaces back and here is a sample project to replicate the leak.
//
//  How to test:
//  Command+I -> Choose Leaks instrument -> Record

import UIKit

// Without @objc this enum won't leak
// however when this enum is included in a class
// which contains an array, it will leak
@objc enum leakingObjCMarkedEnum: Int {
    
    // Just some random cases.
    case apple, orange
}

// Wrapper class which contains an enum and Array
// The class needs to contain the the Array in order for
// the Enum to leak.
class WrapperClass {
  
  // Optional enums marked with @objc will leak.
  var leakyOptionalEnum: leakingObjCMarkedEnum?
  
  // Include an array to trigger this behaviour.
  // Empty arrays won't cause the leak, so lets add an arbitrary Int
  var myArray: [Int] = [80]
}

class ViewController: UIViewController {
  
  // Hang on to a reference to our Wrapper Class instance.
  var wc: WrapperClass?
  
  override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    
    // Allocate an instance of our class
    // and things will start leaking at this point.
    wc = WrapperClass()
  }
}
